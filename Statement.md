Problem Statement: 

The Hangman web game is a digital version of the classic word guessing game where a player attempts to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. The game challenges the player to correctly guess the entire word before the visual representation of a hanged man is completely drawn, indicating the maximum number of incorrect guesses allowed. This project aims to develop an interactive and user-friendly web application providing an engaging platform for users to play Hangman online. 

Scope of the Project: 

This project encompasses the design and implementation of the Hangman game as a web-based application accessible via standard web browsers. It will include a graphical interface displaying the guessed letters, the current state of the hangman drawing, and controls for user input. The game will support features such as randomized word selection, tracking of guesses, and game state management (win/lose scenarios). It will focus on delivering an enjoyable user experience with intuitive controls and visual feedback, suitable for both casual and educational use. 

Target Users: 

The primary users are individuals looking for simple, interactive word guessing games for entertainment or learning purposes. These include students enhancing vocabulary and spelling skills, casual gamers seeking quick and easy games, and educators who may use the game as a tool for teaching language skills. The user base spans all ages due to the game's straightforward rules and accessibility via web platforms.
