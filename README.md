# Vityarthi-Project-
Hangman Web Application

Overview of the project

This project is a fully responsive, web-based implementation of the classic Hangman word guessing game. It transforms the traditional paper-and-pencil game into an interactive digital experience. The application features a Python-based backend using Flask to handle game logic and sessions securely, paired with a modern HTML/CSS frontend for a smooth user interface. It is designed to be deployed easily on cloud platforms like Render.

Features

Interactive Virtual Keyboard: Players can click on-screen buttons to guess letters, which disable automatically after selection.
Dynamic Visual Feedback: The "Hangman" stick figure updates progressively (from h1.png to h7.png ) with every incorrect guess.
Score Tracking: The application tracks the player's score across multiple rounds within a session.
Responsive Design: The layout automatically adjusts for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens using Tailwind CSS.
Secure Game Logic: All word validation and game state management occur on the server side to prevent cheating.
Session Persistence: Uses Flask Sessions to maintain the game state even if the browser is refreshed.

Instructions for testing

To ensure the application is working correctly, follow these testing steps:

Start a Game: Load the webpage. Verify that the score is 0, the word display shows dashes (e.g., _ _ _ _ ), and the keyboard is visible.
Test Correct Guess: Click a letter you suspect is in the word (e.g., vowels like 'A' or 'E').
Expected Result: The letter appears in the correct position(s) in the word display. The button becomes disabled.
Test Incorrect Guess: Click a letter that is likely not in the word (e.g., 'Z' or 'Q').
Expected Result: The hangman image updates (drawing part of the figure), and the error count increases (e.g., "Errors: 1/6").
Test Win Condition: Continue guessing correct letters until the word is complete.
Expected Result: A "YOU WON!" message appears, the score increments by 1, and a "Play Again" button becomes visible.
Test Lose Condition: Intentionally guess wrong 6 times.
Expected Result: A "YOU LOST!" message appears revealing the correct word, the score resets to 0 (unless configured otherwise), and the "Play Again" button appears.
Test Restart: Click the "Play Again" button.
Expected Result: The board resets with a new hidden word, the hangman image resets, and the keyboard buttons are re- enabled.
